# RockPdf

This module is deprecated in favour of my new commercial module: https://www.baumrock.com/en/processwire/modules/rockpdf/

The new module will save you huge amounts of time and is a lot easier to use than mPDF itself or the old version of RockPdf. Read the docs here: https://www.baumrock.com/en/processwire/modules/rockpdf/docs/
